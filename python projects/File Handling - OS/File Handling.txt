Step 1: Plan the Structure
We'll first break down the tasks:

Input Folder: Ask the user for the folder to organize.
Get File Types: List all files and their extensions.
Create Subfolders: Create subfolders based on the file type (e.g., Images, Text, Documents).
Move Files: Move the files to their respective subfolders.
Step 2: Start Coding
We'll start by writing code to:

Get the folder path from the user.
List all files in the folder.

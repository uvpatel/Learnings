    <h1>Chapter - 3(Creating Page layout)</h1>
    <p>When we use the right tag in right place, it results in a better page layout, better indexing
        by search engines and better user experience.
        We use the following tags to get the job done.
        </p>
    <div class="Content">
        <!-- The main opening tag -->
<main>
    <!-- A page section -->
    <section>
    <!-- A self-contained content -->
    <article>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    </article>
    </section>
    <!-- Content aside from the main content (e.g. Ads, sidebars) -->
    <aside>
    <!-- Aside content goes here -->
    </aside>
    </main>
    <!-- The main closing tag -->
    </div>

    <p>Creating a page like this is not necessary but it creates a readable & structured layout.
        Also, they are useful for SEO.</p>
        <div class="link">

            <h3>
                LINK ATTRIBUTES
                <!-- Contact page opens -->
                <!-- Contact page opens in the same tab -->
                <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
                <!-- Contact page opens in a new tab -->
                <a href="/contact" target="_blank">Contact us</a>
            </h3>
            <p>We can put any content inside an anchor tag (images, headings etc are all allowed).
                If the page is inside a directory, we need to make sure that we link to the correct page
(Same applies to img tag as well.)
We can add links to images like this.
<a href = "/about"> <img src="a.jpg" width = "120"> </a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="div-about">
           <h3>
               THE DIV TAG

           </h3> 
            The <div> tag is often used as a container for other elements. It is a block-level element,
            meaning it always takes up the full width available.
            <div>
            <h1>This is a heading inside a div.</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
            </div>

        </div>


        <div class="span">
          <h3>
            THE SPAN TAG
          </h3>  

            The <span> tag is an inline container, meaning it only takes up as much width as
            necessary.
            <p>This is a <span>highlighted</span> word in a sentence.</p>
            </div>
